The program defines a C++ function whatIsThis that takes in an array b of integers and its size size as arguments. The function uses recursion to calculate the sum of the elements in the array b.

In the main function, an array a of 10 integers is declared and initialized. The function whatIsThis is called with the array a and its size arraySize as arguments, and the result is stored in a variable result. Finally, the result is printed to the console using cout.

The whatIsThis function works as follows:

If the size of the array is equal to 1 (the base case), it returns the only element in the array b[0].
If size is greater than 1, it returns the value of the last element in the array b[size-1] plus the result of a recursive call to whatIsThis with b and size-1 as arguments. The recursion continues until the base case is reached and the result is returned up the call stack.
In the end, the program calculates the sum of the elements in the array a and prints it to the console.
