//QUESTION 8.13
The program mystery1 takes two strings, s1 and s2, as inputs. It first moves the pointer s1 to the end of the string. Then, the program copies the characters of the string s2 to the end of s1 (appending s2 to s1). The function does not return a value and the original string1 is modified in main. After the function call, the program outputs the resulting string string1.
