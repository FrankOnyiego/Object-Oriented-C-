//QUESTION 7.17
This program is a C++ program that prompts the user to enter a string and outputs the length of the string.
The function mystery2() takes a string as an argument, loops through the string until the null terminator is found, and increments a counter for each character in the string. The function returns the value of the counter, which is the length of the string. The main() function calls the mystery2() function with the string entered by the user and outputs the result.
